# ü¶† AI Network Guardian: Your Network's AI-Powered Sentry üõ°Ô∏è

![Guardian Logo](assets/guardian_logo.png)

Welcome to the future of personal network management. The AI Network Guardian is a service device designed to give you unprecedented insight and control over your home network. Think of it as the ultimate security tool for your digital life‚Äîa powerful guardian that, when connected to your network, works tirelessly to identify vulnerabilities, monitor activity, and ensure your digital environment is safe.

Powered by the M5Stack LLM630 Compute Kit, this project provides a blueprint for an intelligent, AI-driven agent that helps you understand and manage your network's security posture. It's a tool for learning, for defense, and for taking control. When unplugged, it can audit nearby networks to understand the local wireless landscape. When plugged into your home network, it becomes your personal AI security analyst.

This project is a proof-of-concept for a new era of consumer-friendly, AI-powered cybersecurity tools. It aims to empower users to proactively manage their own network security, making advanced diagnostics accessible to everyone.

## üß† Current AI Capabilities (ZMQ Integration & Autonomous Decision-Making)

The latest version of the script (`app/main.py`) fully integrates an on-device Large Language Model (LLM) using the `pyzmq` library. The AI serves as the central "brain" for the Guardian's operations, dynamically choosing and executing security analysis strategies.

Here is what the AI currently does:

1.  **Autonomous Wi-Fi Environment Analysis & Security Audit Selection:**
    *   The AI receives a real-time, detailed list of all nearby Wi-Fi networks, including SSID, BSSID, encryption type (OPEN, WPA2), signal strength, client count, and WPS status.
    *   It analyzes this data to identify potential security weaknesses in your network or surrounding networks.
    *   It makes a strategic decision on which security audit to perform next, prioritizing the most critical areas for review.
    *   It issues specific JSON commands to the Python script, choosing from:
        *   `{"action": "CONNECT_OPEN", "target_ssid": "..."}` to test the security of open networks.
        *   `{"action": "ATTACK_WPS", "target_ssid": "...", "target_bssid": "..."}` to audit WPS vulnerabilities.
        *   `{"action": "ATTACK_WPA2", "target_ssid": "...", "target_bssid": "..."}` to perform a security audit on your WPA2 network and analyze its password strength.
        *   `{"action": "ATTACK_EVIL_TWIN", "target_ssid": "...", "target_channel": "..."}` to simulate a "rogue access point" attack and test your network's resilience.

2.  **AI-Generated Password Strength Analysis:**
    *   When performing a WPA2 security audit, the script leverages the LLM to generate password candidates based on context (e.g., SSID) to test the strength of your password.
    *   These AI-generated passwords create a persistent, evolving wordlist to help you choose stronger credentials.

3.  **Automated Internal Network Health Analysis:**
    *   Once connected to your network, the AI automatically begins a comprehensive internal security scan.
    *   It receives its current IP, the network subnet, and a detailed list of all connected devices (including OS, open ports, services, and any discovered vulnerabilities or open shares).
    *   The AI then makes a strategic decision on the next analysis action, choosing from:
        *   `{"action": "SCAN_NETWORK"}`: Performs a deep `nmap` scan (`-sV`, `-sC`, `-O`) to map your network and identify all connected devices and services.
        *   `{"action": "VULNERABILITY_SCAN", "target_ip": "...", "port": "..."}`: Launches a `nikto` scan against a specific device to find known vulnerabilities.
        *   `{"action": "BRUTE_FORCE_SERVICE", "target_ip": "...", "port": "...", "service": "..."}`: Uses `hydra` to test the strength of service logins (e.g., SSH, FTP) on your devices.
        *   `{"action": "SCAN_SMB_SHARES", "target_ip": "..."}`: Enumerates open SMB (Windows file sharing) shares to prevent unauthorized data access.
        *   `{"action": "MITM_ATTACK", "target_ip": "...", "gateway_ip": "...", "phishing_domain": "..."}`: Simulates a Man-in-the-Middle attack to test your network's defenses against credential theft.
