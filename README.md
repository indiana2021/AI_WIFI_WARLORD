## üöÄ Project Status: Advanced Prototype

The AI Network Guardian is a mature prototype, featuring robust security analysis modules and sophisticated AI-driven decision-making. It's a truly autonomous agent for managing and securing your personal network.

**Current State (Implemented & AI-Driven):**

*   **Hardware Foundation:** Fully integrated with the M5Stack LLM630 Compute Kit (Axera AX630C SoC with NPU, ESP32-C6).
*   **Core Modules:** Functional classes for Wi-Fi Security Auditing, AI Password Strength Analysis, LAN Analysis, AI Decision-Making, and a Web Dashboard.
*   **AI Orchestration:** The `ai_main_loop` is driven by an on-device LLM, making real-time strategic decisions to identify and mitigate risks.
*   **Web Dashboard:** An enhanced Flask web server with an HTML template provides real-time status, live log streams, network audit results, and detailed connected host information.
*   **Automatic Tool Installation:** The script attempts to install necessary Linux tools (e.g., `dsniff`, `reaver`, `hostapd`, `dnsmasq`, `nikto`, `hydra`, `smbclient`, `metasploit-framework`) for comprehensive analysis.
*   **Security Simulation:** Integrates the Metasploit framework for automated, simulated penetration tests to safely identify and patch vulnerabilities.

## üß† Current AI Capabilities (ZMQ Integration & Autonomous Decision-Making)

The latest version of the script (`app/main.py`) fully integrates an on-device Large Language Model (LLM) using the `pyzmq` library. The AI serves as the central "brain" for the Guardian's operations, dynamically choosing and executing security analysis strategies.

Here is what the AI currently does:

1.  **Autonomous Wi-Fi Environment Analysis & Security Audit Selection:**
    *   The AI receives a real-time, detailed list of all nearby Wi-Fi networks, including SSID, BSSID, encryption type (OPEN, WPA2), signal strength, client count, and WPS status.
    *   It analyzes this data to identify potential security weaknesses in your network or surrounding networks.
    *   It makes a strategic decision on which security audit to perform next, prioritizing the most critical areas for review.
    *   It issues specific JSON commands to the Python script, choosing from:
        *   `{"action": "CONNECT_OPEN", "target_ssid": "..."}` to test the security of open networks.
        *   `{"action": "ATTACK_WPS", "target_ssid": "...", "target_bssid": "..."}` to audit WPS vulnerabilities.
        *   `{"action": "ATTACK_WPA2", "target_ssid": "...", "target_bssid": "..."}` to perform a security audit on your WPA2 network and analyze its password strength.
        *   `{"action": "ATTACK_EVIL_TWIN", "target_ssid": "...", "target_channel": "..."}` to simulate a "rogue access point" attack and test your network's resilience.

2.  **AI-Generated Password Strength Analysis:**
    *   When performing a WPA2 security audit, the script leverages the LLM to generate password candidates based on context (e.g., SSID) to test the strength of your password.
    *   These AI-generated passwords create a persistent, evolving wordlist to help you choose stronger credentials.

3.  **Automated Internal Network Health Analysis:**
    *   Once connected to your network, the AI automatically begins a comprehensive internal security scan.
    *   It receives its current IP, the network subnet, and a detailed list of all connected devices (including OS, open ports, services, and any discovered vulnerabilities or open shares).
    *   The AI then makes a strategic decision on the next analysis action, choosing from:
        *   `{"action": "SCAN_NETWORK"}`: Performs a deep `nmap` scan (`-sV`, `-sC`, `-O`) to map your network and identify all connected devices and services.
        *   `{"action": "VULNERABILITY_SCAN", "target_ip": "...", "port": "..."}`: Launches a `nikto` scan against a specific device to find known vulnerabilities.
        *   `{"action": "BRUTE_FORCE_SERVICE", "target_ip": "...", "port": "...", "service": "..."}`: Uses `hydra` to test the strength of service logins (e.g., SSH, FTP) on your devices.
        *   `{"action": "SCAN_SMB_SHARES", "target_ip": "..."}`: Enumerates open SMB (Windows file sharing) shares to prevent unauthorized data access.
        *   `{"action": "MITM_ATTACK", "target_ip": "...", "gateway_ip": "...", "phishing_domain": "..."}`: Simulates a Man-in-the-Middle attack to test your network's defenses against credential theft.
