"The machines are learning. They are adapting. They are coming for your networks."

Welcome to the cutting edge of autonomous cybersecurity. The AI Wi-Fi Warlord is not just a device; it's a prototype blueprint for a self-governing, AI-driven penetration agent designed to infiltrate, compromise, and dominate wireless and wired networks with unprecedented autonomy. Leveraging the compact power of the M5Stack LLM630 Compute Kit, this project aims to demonstrate a cyber-physical entity capable of executing complex attack chains without constant human oversight.

This project is a proof-of-concept for advanced cybersecurity research and ethical red teaming. Its capabilities, while currently in a conceptual and "bones" state, point towards a future where AI agents can tirelessly identify and exploit vulnerabilities, making human-driven penetration testing more efficient and proactive.

## üöÄ Project Status: Advanced Prototype

The AI Wi-Fi Warlord has moved significantly beyond its initial "bones" state. It now features robust implementations of core attack modules and sophisticated AI-driven decision-making, demonstrating a truly autonomous penetration testing agent.

**Current State (Implemented & AI-Driven):**

*   **Hardware Foundation:** Integration with M5Stack LLM630 Compute Kit (Axera AX630C SoC with NPU, ESP32-C6).
*   **Core Modules:** Fully functional classes for Wi-Fi Attack, AI Password Cracking, LAN Attacks, AI Decision-Making, and Web Dashboard.
*   **AI Orchestration:** The `ai_main_loop` is now driven by an on-device LLM, making real-time strategic decisions for both Wi-Fi and post-exploitation phases.
*   **Web Dashboard:** Enhanced Flask web server with HTML template for real-time status, live log streams, cracked networks, and detailed compromised host information.
*   **Automatic Tool Installation:** The script now attempts to install necessary Linux tools (e.g., `dsniff`, `reaver`, `hostapd`, `dnsmasq`, `nikto`, `hydra`, `smbclient`) if they are not found on the system.

## üß† Current AI Capabilities (ZMQ Integration & Autonomous Decision-Making)

The latest version of the script (`app/main.py`) fully integrates an on-device Large Language Model (LLM) using the `pyzmq` library to communicate with the M5Stack's StackFlow framework. The AI now serves as the central decision-making "brain" for the Warlord's operations, dynamically choosing and executing attack strategies.

Here is what the AI currently does:

1.  **Autonomous Wi-Fi Target Selection & Attack Method Selection:**
    *   The AI receives a real-time, detailed list of all nearby Wi-Fi networks discovered by `airodump-ng`, including SSID, BSSID, encryption type (OPEN, WPA2), signal strength, client count, and WPS status.
    *   It analyzes this comprehensive data, considering factors like encryption type, WPS enablement, signal strength, client presence, and previously cracked networks.
    *   It makes a strategic decision on which network to attack next and *how* to attack it, prioritizing the most vulnerable and promising targets.
    *   It issues specific JSON commands to the Python script, choosing from:
        *   `{"action": "CONNECT_OPEN", "target_ssid": "..."}` for open, unsecured networks.
        *   `{"action": "ATTACK_WPS", "target_ssid": "...", "target_bssid": "..."}` to exploit WPS vulnerabilities.
        *   `{"action": "ATTACK_WPA2", "target_ssid": "...", "target_bssid": "..."}` to initiate a handshake capture and crack on an encrypted network.
        *   `{"action": "ATTACK_EVIL_TWIN", "target_ssid": "...", "target_channel": "..."}` to launch a fake access point and captive portal for credential harvesting.

2.  **AI-Generated Password Cracking:**
    *   When a WPA2 handshake is captured, or for brute-forcing services, the script leverages the LLM to generate highly targeted password candidates based on context (e.g., SSID).
    *   These AI-generated passwords are dynamically appended to an external file on the SD card, creating a persistent, evolving wordlist.

3.  **Automated Post-Exploitation Decision-Making & Execution:**
    *   The moment the AI confirms a successful connection to a target network, it automatically pivots to the next phase.
    *   It receives its current IP, the network subnet, and a detailed list of all currently compromised hosts (including OS, open ports, services, and any previously found vulnerabilities, credentials, or SMB shares).
    *   The AI then makes a strategic decision on the next post-exploitation action, choosing from:
        *   `{"action": "SCAN_NETWORK"}`: Performs a deep `nmap` scan (`-sV`, `-sC`, `-O`) to discover hosts, services, and OS details.
        *   `{"action": "VULNERABILITY_SCAN", "target_ip": "...", "port": "..."}`: Launches a `nikto` scan against a specific web server to find vulnerabilities.
        *   `{"action": "BRUTE_FORCE_SERVICE", "target_ip": "...", "port": "...", "service": "..."}`: Uses `hydra` to attempt to crack logins for services like SSH or FTP using generated password lists.
        *   `{"action": "SCAN_SMB_SHARES", "target_ip": "..."}`: Enumerates open SMB (Windows file sharing) shares on a target host.
        *   `{"action": "MITM_ATTACK", "target_ip": "...", "gateway_ip": "...", "phishing_domain": "..."}`: Initiates ARP poisoning and deploys an AI-generated phishing website to capture credentials.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Full Capabilities List: What the Warlord Can Do

The AI Wi-Fi Warlord is now a comprehensive, multi-stage attack agent. Here's a breakdown of its current implemented capabilities:

### üì° Wi-Fi Infiltration & Access Gained

*   **Autonomous Network Discovery:** Intelligently scans and enumerates nearby Wi-Fi networks (SSID, BSSID, Channel, Encryption, Signal Strength, WPS status, Client Count).
*   **Intelligent Target & Attack Selection:** AI dynamically chooses the best attack (CONNECT_OPEN, ATTACK_WPS, ATTACK_WPA2, ATTACK_EVIL_TWIN) based on real-time network data.
*   **WPA/WPA2 Handshake Capture:** Automated deauthentication attacks to force client reconnections and capture 4-way handshakes.
*   **AI-Accelerated Password Cracking:**
    *   **Known Password List Brute-Forcing:** Rapidly tests captured handshakes against extensive common password dictionaries.
    *   **Generative Brute-Forcing:** Leverages the on-board NPU to run LLMs for intelligent, context-aware password candidate generation, dynamically saving them to SD card.

    *   **Phishing Portal:** Deploys AI-generated phishing websites via Evil Twin or MITM attacks to capture user credentials.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** Initiates ARP poisoning using `arpspoof` to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
*   **DNS Spoofing:** Redirects target domains to malicious pages (e.g., fake login portals) for credential harvesting or content injection.

### üß† AI Orchestration: The Brain
